# Launch Plan - Prioritized & Realistic

**Repo**: https://github.com/eduardd76/AI_for_networking_and_security_engineers
**Current accounts**: LinkedIn only
**Goal**: Get in front of network engineers, drive GitHub stars, build audience

---

## Phase 1: High-ROI, Low Effort (Week 1)

### ✅ You Already Have: LinkedIn
**Priority**: 🔥 HIGHEST
**Why**: Professional network engineers, easy engagement, you already have connections
**Time**: 5 minutes

**Action Plan:**
1. I'll draft the LinkedIn post (already did!)
2. You review and post from your account
3. Tag: #NetworkEngineering #AI #Automation #NetOps #DevOps

**Expected Results**: 50-200 views, 5-15 comments, 10-30 GitHub stars

---

### 📱 New Account Needed: Reddit
**Priority**: 🔥 HIGHEST (best ROI for GitHub projects)
**Setup time**: 3 minutes
**Why**: r/networking has 500K+ network engineers

**Account Setup:**
1. Go to reddit.com
2. Sign up with email (eduardd76 or similar username)
3. Verify email
4. Wait 24 hours (Reddit filters brand-new accounts)
5. Post on Day 2

**Subreddits to Target (in order):**
1. **r/networking** (500K members) - best fit
2. **r/sysadmin** (450K members) - adjacent audience
3. **r/devops** (200K members) - automation focus
4. **r/networkingjobs** (25K members) - career development

**Strategy**: Post every 2-3 days (not all at once = spam)

**Expected Results**: 100-500 upvotes, 50-100 comments, 200-500 GitHub stars

---

### 💰 New Account Needed: Ko-fi (Optional but Easy)
**Priority**: 🟡 MEDIUM
**Setup time**: 5 minutes

2. Sign up: ko-fi.com/eduardd76
3. Add description: "Supporting AI for Network Engineers book"
4. Add GitHub link

## Phase 2: Medium Effort (Week 2-3)

### 🐦 New Account Needed: Twitter/X

### 🎙️ Podcast Outreach

## Phase 3: Long-Term (Month 2+)

### 📝 Content Platforms

**Setup time**: 10 minutes each
**Why**: SEO, authority building

**Platforms:**
1. **Medium** - republish chapters as articles
2. **Dev.to** - developer community
3. **Hashnode** - technical blogging

**Strategy**: 1 article per week, link back to GitHub
