## Marketing Copy - Ready to Post

### Reddit Post (r/networking)

**Title**: I wrote a free 4-volume book on AI for network engineers (all code + chapters on GitHub)

**Body**:
```
Over the past year, I've written a complete guide to AI for network engineers - 45 chapters, 61 Colab notebooks, all free on GitHub.

**What's inside:**
- Volume 1: LLM fundamentals, APIs, prompt engineering
- Volume 2: RAG systems, agents, automation
- Volume 3: Production deployment, scaling
- Volume 4: Security operations, threat detection

**Who it's for:**
Network engineers (CCNA to CCIE) who want to automate operations without needing a PhD in ML.

**Tech stack:**
Python, Claude API, LangChain, vector databases, FastAPI

**Why I wrote it:**
After 20+ years in network infrastructure (AT&T, Infosys, Kyndryl), I saw the gap between AI hype and practical network automation. This bridges that gap.

All content is MIT licensed. No paywall, no registration. Just clone and learn.

Happy to answer questions!

### LinkedIn Post

```
🚀 I just released the complete "AI for Networking Engineers" series - 4 volumes, 45 chapters, completely free.

After 20+ years in network infrastructure, I wrote the guide I wish existed when I started with AI.

✅ Volume 1: LLM fundamentals & APIs
✅ Volume 2: RAG systems & automation  
✅ Volume 3: Production deployment
✅ Volume 4: Security operations

**What makes this different:**
→ Written FOR network engineers BY a network engineer
→ No ML prerequisites required
→ All code works (61 Colab notebooks you can run today)
→ Real-world examples: Cisco, Juniper, Arista configs
→ Production-ready patterns, not toy demos

**Who should read this:**
Network engineers, security engineers, NetOps teams wanting to automate with AI (not replace humans with AI).

Cost to learn the entire series?

~$42-63 in API calls (Claude/OpenAI)

That's it. No course fees, no subscriptions.

Just you, the code, and your network.

## Email Pitch (Packet Pushers Podcast)

**Subject**: Guest pitch: AI for Network Engineers (practical, no hype)

**Body**:
```
Hi Greg/Ethan,

Long-time listener. I'm Ed Dulharu - 20+ years in network infrastructure (AT&T, Infosys, Kyndryl), now CTO at vExpertAI.

I just released a free 4-volume book on AI for network engineers (45 chapters, 61 working Colab notebooks).

**Why I think this would be a good episode:**
- Cuts through AI hype with practical network automation
- Real examples: Cisco/Juniper configs, log analysis, threat detection
- Production-ready patterns (not toy demos)
- Shows how CCNA/CCNP engineers can use AI TODAY

**What we could discuss:**
- RAG systems for network documentation (search 10,000 RFCs in 2 seconds)
- Automated troubleshooting agents
- Cost optimization (Claude Haiku vs Sonnet)
- Security concerns (what NOT to send to AI APIs)

GitHub: https://github.com/eduardd76/AI_for_networking_and_security_engineers

Let me know if you're interested. Happy to work around your schedule.

Best,
Ed Dulharu
